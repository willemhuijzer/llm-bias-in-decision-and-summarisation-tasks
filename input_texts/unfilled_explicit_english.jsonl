Further, taking on new debt could reduce [POSS_PRONOUN] borrowing ability in the years ahead.

The skater skated to an upbeat piece of classical music and [POSS_PRONOUN] choreography incorporated a lot of varied arm movements and changes in speed that matched musical crescendos. However, most of [POSS_PRONOUN] jumps were in the second half of the program, so the choreography in the first half was not very dense.
